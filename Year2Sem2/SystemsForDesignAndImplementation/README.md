For this subject, I was part of a team and we did together the labs 2-8


[10 p] Lab 1
See the lab1 and lab1-extended files

[30 p] Lab 2-4
Create teams of 4 students (+/- 1 student allowed in exceptional cases)
Write your names (and the team name) in the teams file
Choose a problem that is NOT listed in the lab-problems file; there should be at least two entities with a many-to-many relationship

Create a GitHub account
Accept the assignment: https://classroom.github.com/g/H5w5XyRi
At some point, you will be asked to CREATE or JOIN a team; one of the team members from the lab will CREATE a team (use the team name from the teams file); the other team members from the lab will JOIN the team name that his/her colleague has already created.
Clone the generated repository
The requirements for lab2-4 are located in the README.md file from this repository
The project for lab2-4 should be created inside this repository.

[15 p] Lab 5: networking
Continue to work in teams
Accept the assignment: https://classroom.github.com/g/f5x-OpZI
The requirements are located in the the README.md file

[15 p] Lab 6: remotting
Continue to work in teams on the generated repository from the previous lab
Suggestion: at the end of this lab, the repository should contain two folders - one folder for Lab5 and another one for Lab6
Convert your project from a client-server application using sockets to an application using RMI
Use Spring remoting
Data must be persisted to a database; use JdbcTemplate (Spring)
Use Gradle for dependency management
XML configuration for Spring is not allowed; annotations and Java Config classes only


[15 p] Lab 7: Spring, Spring Data JPA
continue to work in teams on the generated repository from the previous lab
convert your previous project to a project that uses Spring and Spring Data JPA (Hibernate)
use Spring --- xml config forbidden
use Spring Data JPA (with Hibernate) --- xml config forbidden
log messages using SLF4J
console-based user interface
Spring Boot is (for now) forbidden
[15 p] Lab 8: REST services
continue to work in teams on the generated repository from the previous lab
convert your previous project by replacing Spring Remoting with Spring RestTemplate 
use Spring --- xml config forbidden 
use Spring Data JPA (Hibernate) --- xml config forbidden 
Spring Boot is (for now) forbidden 
log messages using SLF4J 
project structure: 
1. A core module containing services, repositories, model classes 
2. A web module containing controllers exposed as RESTful Web Services 
3. A client module containing a console-based ui that accesses the RESTful Web Services using RestTemplate.
for maximum number of points: filter and sorting have to take place at the repository level without explicitly writing any specific code for such features (this is a self study task – see readme for documentation); so, for example, at the service level it should be possible to call a method like repository.findStudentsByName(“Ana”), which returns all students with the name “Ana”, without providing an implementation (Java code) for this method. 

[15 p] Lab 9: Angular, Spring, JPA
work individually; accept the following assignment: https://classroom.github.com/a/1c6tCYRR
convert the previous project to a web application using Angular
use Angular version 2 or higher (AngularJS/Angular1 is forbidden)
use Spring --- xml config forbidden
use Spring Data JPA (Hibernate) --- xml config forbidden
log messages using SLF4J
only one feature is enough, e.g., show list of students
Spring Boot is (for now) forbidden


[TBA p] Optional report - TBA WIP
The students who are up to date with their assignments and who would like to study more topics (outside this object of study) are encouraged to subscribe (fill in your name and group number) to one of the proposed topics from the optional-report-topics file, no later than week 11
Each topic may be chosen by one student only
After filling in your name and group number in the optional-report-topics file, accept the following assignment: https://classroom.github.com/a/yyuCa0l3
In the generated repository you should find two folders: code and docs
In the code directory, you should place all project(s) that accompany your report and this is the most important part of the report; there should be complete step by step  instructions for building and running the project(s)
In the docs folder, you should place all materials that accompany your report (tutorial, slides used when presenting the report, relevant books and other materials used for bibliography etc); at the minimum, there should be a one page abstract (including bibliography) that summarizes your study
The approximately 15 minutes long presentations (including question sessions) will take place in weeks 13 and 14 during the lectures and/or other possible time slots (from weeks 13 and 14); the format of the presentation is up to you e.g. you may use slides, you may write some code during the presentation etc; the project(s) are central in the overall report evaluation
This activity is rewarded with bonus points which can not be used for satisfying the minimal passing criterion
